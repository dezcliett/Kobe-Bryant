        Kobe Bryant. Just the name brings up fond memories for many. For some, its 2010 when you were able to witness Kobe overcome the Boston Celtics Superteam. For others, its Kobe and Shaq dominating whatever Eastern opponent they had in the finals. For me, a sixers (and eagles) fan, Kobe was from the same area. For Philadelphians, we understand the Los Angeles fans pain as much as any other fanbase can. Kobe celebrated as hard as we did when the Eagles won in 2017. Kobe will be celebrated not just for his contribution to basketball, but for his contributions to humanity. An advocate for womans sports, he hoped to open a new chapter in his life when his daughter GiGi was showing a similar level of love for the game of basketball. Kobe Bryant is more than an NBA superstar,he is an American icon. #RIPKOBE #RIPGIGI, you will always be remembered.
